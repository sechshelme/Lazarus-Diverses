### Thanks
This project is only possible thanks to [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/ "Free Pascal"), [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/ "Lazarus") and the fabulous compiler [Pas2JS](http://wiki.freepascal.org/pas2js "Pas2JS")

### Requirements
* Lazarus 2.1 or newer
* _pas2js_ 2.0 or newer

### Help Please
This project is under development.
This version is an basic implementation and many bugs need to be corrected.
Please help us to take this project forward.

### Install
This was tested with Lazarus 2.1 using version 2.0 of _pas2js_.
* make sure that the _pas2jsdsgn_ package is installed
* the _pas2js_rtl_ package should have been opened (so that the IDE knows about it)
* install the _wcldsgn_ package from _design/package_
* open the _wcl_ package in _widgets_ (again so that the IDE knows about it)

### Usage
* create a new _Web GUI Application_

### Notes
* you can only use components from the _WCL_ tab

### Further plans
* test data module template
* implement support for DB controls
* implement a Lazarus compatible grid
* better maintenance of the project's HTML file
* better maintenance of the project's main program file
* more dynamic layouting of the components
