# CSS Minify/extract Class names demo.

This project needs an example from FPC; it needs a server application that
does the actual minifying.

The CGI (http server) application is located in packages/fcl-css/examples/fpcss.pp

The program here expects it to be available as fpcss.cgi.
You must change the createurl function in this demo if you decide to place
it elsewhere.
